#
# Here you will use the Knapsack Problem to learn about Pareto Fronts.
#
# **Main Take Aways**.   
# * Optimisation concepts *Decision Spaces* and *Objective Spaces*: you will learn what they are and how to define these for the knapsack problem.
# * The limitations of the commonly practiced Single Objective Optimisation.  
# * Pareto Fronts: identifying by eye Pareto optimal solutions within a distribution as well as pseudocode for selecting these *Non-Dominated* solutions.
#
#
#
# **The Knapsack Problem**   
# In this challenge you will fill virtual knapsacks with packages that have monetary value and weight.   
# The objective is to minimise the final weight of the knapsack and maximise the total monetary value of its contents.    
# (You will also be able to change the objectives from min-max to the other options: max-max and min-min, max-min.)

# **Recommended Notebook Usage**

# There is no need to understand every line of Python, especially in the first run! Reading the cell headers is sufficient to understand what a cell does.  It is more important to understand the text in the Markdown cells and the visuals created.  
#
# We recommend doing the first run until the [Summary](#Summary) section as is. 
# Afterwhich we recommend that you explore different types of results by modfiying the variables flagged with ***CHANGE ME!***. We list in the [Summary](#Summary) section suggested actions to take, but feel free to be creative!

#     *  `value_distribution_mode=squared` - monetary value is squared that of the weights (up to some noise quantified by `noise_factor`).  
#     
# This will results in

# #  Decision Space
#
# In optimisation the ***Decision Space*** is defined as the parameters which the user has control over.   
#
# In the knapsack problem we have decide which packages to put in a knapsack.    
#
# If the number of possible package combinations is small enough we can examine (by brute force) all possible knapsacks created by the packages. That is the objective of this notebook. (In the subsequent tutorial we will discuss optimising in an intractable decision space.)  

# ## Decision Space Size
#
# There are two parameters of interest that decide how many knapsacks are possible: 
# * `N_PACKAGES` which was determined in [Packages](#Packages).
# * `N_PACKAGES_PER_KNAPSACK` introduced here determines the number of packages that fit into a knapsack.  
#
#
# We can easily calculate the number of combinations defined as an unordered arrangement of $k$ objects from a set of $n$, which is called  *$n$ choose $k$*.  
#
# which is calculated as:  
# $$
# _nC_k=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}\equiv {n \choose k}
# $$
#
# Here we use     
# `k = N_PACKAGES_PER_KNAPSACK`  
# `n = N_PACKAGES`,  
# with assumptions for simplicity:  
# * A package can appear only once in a a knapsack.  
# * The order of a package assigned to a knapsack does not matter. 
#
# **Note**  
# You do not need to understand the equation above.  
# Below you are provided with:   
# * a calculator that executes this equation using the `math.factorial` function   
# * `itertools.combinations` function that creates all *n-choose-k* combinations. 
#
# **Important!**   
# To use `itertools.combinations` to create all *n-choose-k* combinations make sure that the calculator results in a reasonable amount of combinations that you computer can handle. Prior to quantum computing 10,000 should be sufficient. Above that a single processor might struggle to run this notebook.

# **Interim Checkpoint**
#
# Can you define:  
# * What is the Decision Space? 
# * What is the Decision Space for the knapsack problem?  
#
# Bonus question:  
# Can you explain why the number of packages per knapsack defines the size of the Decision Space?  

# # Objective Space
#
# In optimisation the ***Objective Space*** is defined as the parameters we are interested in optimising for.  
#

#
# The Objective Space is related to the Decision Space via a mapping.
#
# In the knapsack problem we define the Objective Space as the weights of the knapsacks and their content monetary value.

# The mapping from the Decision Space (the packages in each knapsack) is covered in this section using the `knapsack_objective` function.

# **Interim Summary**  
#
# This is the stage where a lot analyses stop and decisions are made.  
#
# For a budge of $N$ best solutions, the process so far has been:  
# * combining multiple parameters into a single heuristic
# * sorting all solutions according to this heuristic
# * selecting the top ($N\geq1$) solutions as "optimal".  
#
#
# Whereas this technique is quite intuitive, easy to apply and broadly used, it comes with one main flaw:
#
# > It limits the view of the objective space, possibly resuting in suboptimal results.  
#
# In other words, this procedure is stopping short from a true in-depth exploration of that decision-objective spaces.   
# The 1D histogram above is the equivalent of horse blinders. 
#
# <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Horses_2.jpg" width=150>

# In the above we see that the Single Objective Optimiser selected one regions of possible interest, but perhaps we can do better? Pareto Fronts help us gauge better decisions. 

# # Pareto Optimal Solutions
# Here you will apply and visualise a Pareto Front algorithm to find solutions that are called *Pareto Optimal*.
#
#
# In the Single Objective Optimisation approach we pre-determined the relationship between the objectives `value` and `weights` prior to creating the heuristic which we used to select the "best/optimal" solution(s).  
#
# An alternative approach is to be agnostic, where we treat the objectives as independent/orthogonal. In most real life problems we do not know the relationships between the objectives. E.g, imagine in the case of the knapsack problem that we do not know the monetary value of the weight.   
#
# This means that we can examine the actual distribution in the Objective Space and find solutions (knapsacks) that are *Non Dominated*, which we call *Pareto Optimal*.  
#
# Let's define these using the diagram below in which we want to maximise for both objectives.
#
# <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Pareto_Efficient_Frontier_1024x1024.png" width=300>
#
# * ***Dominated*** solutions (in gray) are those for which we can find at least one other solution that dominates in all objectives.  
# E.g, solution $K$ is dominated by solution $D$ which has higher values in both objectives. There are actually 3 more solutions that dominate $K$. Can you identify all of them?  
#
# * ***Non Dominated*** solutions (in red; also called ***Pareto Optimal***) are those for which there is no other solution that dominates it in all the objectives.  
# E.g, solution $C$ is not dominated by any other solution in respect to all the objectives. It is dominated by $B$ in the objective 2, but not by objective 1. Solution $D$ dominates $C$ by objective 1 but not by 2. Solutions $B$ and $D$  do not dominate $C$ in both and hence the latter is considered Pareto Optimal. 
#
# **Pareto Front**
#
# <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Vilfredo_Pareto_1870s2.jpg" width=100>
#
#
#
# Named after the engineer and economist [Vilfredo Pareto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto), we define the Pareto Front as the set of Non Dominated solutions, and consider them (at first*) as equally optimal trade-off solutions.
#
# *We will eventually have to apply a subjective ranking. This will be decissed in [Decision Making With Pareto Fronts](#Decision-Making-With-Pareto-Fronts). 
#
# Now that we know what Pareto Optimal solutions are let's see how we calculate them.  
#
# Before using an algorithm in Python let's examine its pseudocode. 

# **Pareto Front Pseudo Code**  
#
# * Input: `knapsacks` is a list of knapsack objects each with properties `weight`, `value`.  
# * Output: `pareto_front` is subset list of  `knapsacks` containing Pareto optimal solutions that minimises  `weight` and maximises `value`.  
#
# ```python
# --- start ---
# pareto_front = []
#
# for this_knapsack in knapsacks:
#     is_pareto = True   # we assume that this_knapsack is Pareto Optimal until proven otherwise
#     
#     other_knapsacks = knapsacks.remove(this_knapsack)
#     
#     for other_knapsack in other_knapsacks:
#         # Does `other_knapsack` dominate `this_knapsack`?  
#         other_dominates  = this_knapsack['weight'] > other_knapsacks['weight']
#         other_dominates &= this_knapsack['value'] < other_knapsacks['value']
#

# # Summary
#
# Here we summarise the lessons from our brute force aproach to exploring the solution space.
#
# * During the optimisation process we are required to make a subjective decision in regards to selection of the "optimal" or "best" solution(s).  
#
# * In the Single Objective Optimisation approach we make an a-priori decision about the relationships between the objectives. This exposes the decision maker to a narrow point of view of the options, which might result in a choice that, otherwise, might be considered sub-optimal.  
#
# * To avoid this issue it is recommended to first treat the objectves as independent, which will enable examination of the full Objective Space. This is likely to result in a better decision.  
#
# * To this end, a useful tool for decision makeing is The Pareto Front, which is defined a set of equally-optimal trade-off Non Dominated (Pareto Optimal) solutions.  
#

# Congratulations! 
# You have just learned the fundamentals of Pareto Fronts.
#
# To further grasp some of the points made, you are encouraged to explore different distributions and set different objectives. Below is a a suggested list of actions you can take to further learn the topic. Choose one that seems interesting to you, update the notebook and rerun the cells to see how the results vary.
#
# **Actions To Take**
#
# - [ ] Change the optimisation objective to minimising both weight and monetary value.   
# This is done, e.g, by setting `objective_mode={'weight': 'min', 'value': 'min'}` in [Optimisation Objective](#Optimisation-Objective).   
# Try to guess in advance which knapsacks are considered Pareto Optimal!   
# Try all four combinations.  
# - [ ] Examine the $value\sim weight^2$ distribution by modifying `value_distribution_mode="squared"` in [Packages](#Packages).
# - [ ] Create your own distribution! Create your own custom `value_distribution_mode` in [Packages](#Packages). 

# # Decision Making With Pareto Fronts
#
# Once the Pareto Front is identified a decision has to be made about selection of the $N$ best solutions.  
# In other words, now is the time to apply a subjective decsion which will determine how we rank the solutions.  
#
# How to select, of course, will depend on the project budget and objectives but broadly speaking the subjective decision will be determined by:
#
# * The $N$ number of solutions that will be used for the next step. In our example, you might have four knapsack carriers, so you will want to give each one knapsack.   
# * After examining the exhaustive solution space the decision maker might apply weights. This results in a single heuristic reducing the problem to Single Objective Optimisation. 
# * The decision maker might decide to narrow in on solutions in one or multiple regions. Otherwise they could sample across the Pareto Front.  
#
# **Note**  
# Here the term *decision maker* is used broadly. The meaning is someone with domain expertise who could be anyone from the analyst, to someone non technical that understands the field. 
#
#
# **Note 2**  
# Here we focus on an Objective Space that has two parameters ($2D$). Ideas here can be naturally extrapolated to higher dimensions (3 or more objectives), although this might be more challenging to visualise. One mechanism is visualising 2D slices, and color coding a 3rd dimension.   
#
#
# *For your own amusement (and education) I highly recommend watching [The Expert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObA9WGiQqLY&ab_channel=Adnan). This was recommended to me in during transition from academia to the private sector, and is an excellent life lesson on (mis)communication in a professional environment.  
#

# # Next Up: Rerun With A Larger Search Space!
#
# In this tutorial we focused on learning about the Pareto Front in an exhaustive search setting, i.e, where we can brute force our way to the full solution space.  
#
# In reality, however, you are likley to deal with much larger combinatorial spaces.  
#
# Play around with this calculator to see how large the Knapsack problem can get by modfiying `N_PACKAGES` and `N_PACKAGES_PER_KNAPSACK`.  

# +
# if you set N_PACKAGES=20,000, N_PACKAGES_PER_KNAPSACK=30 you get 
# 4e+96 knapsacks, i.e, more package combinations than atoms in the observable universe! (estimated e+78 to e+82)

N_PACKAGES = 20000 
N_PACKAGES_PER_KNAPSACK = 30
# -----------
    
n = N_PACKAGES
k = N_PACKAGES_PER_KNAPSACK

n_combinations = factorial(n)//factorial(k)//factorial(n-k)

f'There are {pretty_int(n_combinations)} combinations of {n} choose {k}.'

# In the case of a large intractable objective space we will need to use a stochastic method to navigate the combinatorial space.
