# # `DEAP` as a Prototyping Tool
#
# <img src="https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/_images/deap_long.png" width=300>
#
#
# > `DEAP` is a novel evolutionary computation framework for rapid prototyping and testing of ideas. It seeks to make algorithms explicit and data structures transparent. It works in perfect harmony with parallelisation mechanism such as multiprocessing and `SCOOP`. 
#
# `DEAP` contains numerous concepts and many features to build your own evolutions.
#
# [`DEAP` Documentation](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/)

# Here we demo its use to solve for the Knapsack problem.
#
# <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Knapsack.svg" width=250>
#
#
# For the most part we follow thier [Knapsack tutorial](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/examples/ga_knapsack.html), in which the individual knapsacks inherite from `set`s.

# ## Objectives via Fitness 
#
# > The provided `Fitness` class is an abstract class that needs a weights attribute in order to be functional. A minimizing fitness is built using negatives weights, while a maximizing fitness has positive weights. For example, the following line creates, in the creator, a ready to use single objective minimizing fitness named FitnessMin.
#
# Single Objective Optimisation
# ```python
# creator.create("FitnessMin", base.Fitness, weights=(-1.0,))
# ```
#
# Multi-Objective Optimisation
# ```python
# creator.create("FitnessMulti", base.Fitness, weights=(-1.0, 1.0))
# ```
#
# `weights`: `-1` is for minmising and `1` is for maximising
#
# > The weights can also be used to vary the importance of each objective one against another. This means that the weights can be any real number and only the sign is used to determine if a maximization or minimization is done. An example of where the weights can be useful is in the crowding distance sort made in the NSGA-II selection algorithm.

#     * OR reproduction (cloning)

# Note:
#
# Above we see that we have selected
# * `CXPB` - The probability that an individual is selected for mating
# * `MUTPB` - The probability that an individual is selected for mutation
#
# Besides mating and mutating there is a third option for an individual: reproduction (i.e, to be cloned).   
# * `1 - CXPB - MUTPB`   - The probablilty that an indiviaul is selected for reproduction (i.e, cloning)
#
# In my experience, when `CXPB - MUTPB != 1` (i.e, we enable cloning) the diversity is substantially reduced, and so I set `CXPB - MUTPB = 1`.

                    operators.
    :param mu: The number of individuals to select for the next generation.
    :param lambda\_: The number of children to produce at each generation.

                  inplace, optional.
    :param halloffame: A :class:`~deap.tools.HallOfFame` object that will

    :returns: The final population
    :returns: A class:`~deap.tools.Logbook` with the statistics of the

    The algorithm takes in a population and evolves it in place using the
    :func:`varOr` function. It returns the optimized population and a
    :class:`~deap.tools.Logbook` with the statistics of the evolution. The
    logbook will contain the generation number, the number of evaluations for
    each generation and the statistics if a :class:`~deap.tools.Statistics` is
    given as argument. The *cxpb* and *mutpb* arguments are passed to the
    :func:`varOr` function. The pseudocode goes as follow ::
        evaluate(population)
        for g in range(ngen):
            offspring = varOr(population, toolbox, lambda_, cxpb, mutpb)
            evaluate(offspring)
            population = select(population + offspring, mu)
    First, the individuals having an invalid fitness are evaluated. Second,
    the evolutionary loop begins by producing *lambda_* offspring from the
    population, the offspring are generated by the :func:`varOr` function. The
    offspring are then evaluated and the next generation population is
    selected from both the offspring **and** the population. Finally, when
    *ngen* generations are done, the algorithm returns a tuple with the final
    population and a :class:`~deap.tools.Logbook` of the evolution.
    This function expects :meth:`toolbox.mate`, :meth:`toolbox.mutate`,
    :meth:`toolbox.select` and :meth:`toolbox.evaluate` aliases to be
    registered in the toolbox. This algorithm uses the :func:`varOr`
    variation.
